# Typing-Test-Game
With the use of threading(to start two functions at once), functions, classes, external text files, if/else statements, and try/except blocks, this program calculates adjusted words per minute(AWPM). This program also creates a line graph to show user progress, available upon the completion of two or more rounds of the game.
