God of War is an action-adventure game franchise that has become a flagship series for PlayStation.

Based on ancient Greek mythology, the story follows Kratos, a Spartan warrior and later the Greek God

of War, who was tricked into killing his family by his former master, the original Greek God of

War Ares. This sets off a series of events that leads to the collapse of the Greek pantheon.
