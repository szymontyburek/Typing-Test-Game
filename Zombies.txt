Zombies, originally Nazi Zombies, is a game mode created by Treyarch. Up to four players must survive

endless waves of attacking zombies, earning points from killing or damaging zombies and repairing

barriers. These points can be used to purchase weapons and Perk-a-Colas in the process, or unlock

new areas and activate other special objects. Zombies become stronger, faster, and swarm in higher

numbers upon the completion of each round. On occasion, zombies will drop various power-ups such

as Max Ammo, Nuke, or Insta-Kill upon their death, making the round easier.
